According to cops Michael called police on Thursday evening after Kate flew into a drunken rage and attacked him at their home in Boca Raton, Florida. The pair allegedly began squabbling after Michael accused her of cheating before she scratched him across his back. Kate claimed that Michael grabbed her by the throat and had provoked the fight. But according to the officer, Kate had no visible signs of any injuries and she even &quot;scratched her throat area in an attempt to create red marks.&quot; Following the incident she was taken to Palm Beach County jail and charged with battery.
