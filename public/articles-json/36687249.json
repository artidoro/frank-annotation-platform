No player deserves what he has had in the last three or four years.Former US Open champion Del Potro, 27, reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2013 but the former world number four is playing in his first Grand Slam since the Australian Open in 2014 after having three wrist operations.He struggled early on as Wawrinka, 31, claimed an early break before comfortably taking the opening set, but Del Potro fought back well to take the second.Both players broke serve twice in the opening four games of a thrilling third set, which Del Potro won in a tie-break, before taking the fourth set to wrap up victory.\"It feels amazing,\" Del Potro told BBC Sport. \"I beat one of the guys who is playing great tennis this season and I couldn't have expected this before today.\"I enjoyed the crowd, they were incredible and I'm very happy.\"It is my second or third career now after all the injuries.
