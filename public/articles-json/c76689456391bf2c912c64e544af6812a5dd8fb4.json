It affects  lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell - which are found in the blood and in lymph glands. Lymphoma is a disease where lymphocyte B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way. Patients with the cancer experience a swelling in the lymph nodes.

Something that I will cherish forever.' The pair, began dating in January 2013 after meeting online. But six months into their relationship, John was was diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma. It is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's immune system, made up of organs such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes.
