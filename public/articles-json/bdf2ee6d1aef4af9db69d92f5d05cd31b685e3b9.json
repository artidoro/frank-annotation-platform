    "article": "While it emerged this week that an airport baggage handler in Seattle fell asleep on the job and wound up flying in cargo - on the other side of the country it appears there's no slacking to be had. NBC journalist Jeff Rossen filmed an airport worker at LaGuardia Airport in New York doing push-ups on the runway after loading a plane. Footage shows the employee wearing his high-visibility jacket and gloves while performing the aerobic stunt. Even after his 12th push-up, the fitness-enthusiast shows no sign of slowing down. Scroll down for video Breaking sweat: NBC journalist Jeff Rossen filmed an airport worker at LaGuardia Airport in New York doing push-ups on the runway after loading up a plane No time for sleep! Footage shows the employee wearing his high-visibility jacket and gloves while performing the aerobic stunt 'This guy is the picture of fitness. Working and doing push-ups in his free time,' Rossen says as he watches the exercise session unfold. An airline worker in the foreground appears to be unfazed by the scene as he catches glimpse of the baggage handler pumping iron. Rossen later uploaded the 12-second clip of the pro-active employee to social media along with the caption: 'Hardest working man at LaGuardia...from my window.' The video - filmed April 19 - quickly garnered dozens of 'Likes' on Facebook, with one commenter musing: 'Heavy bags need big muscles.' Eye-witness: Rossen (pictured here) later uploaded the 12-second clip of the pro-active employee to social media along with the caption: 'Hardest working man at LaGuardia... from my window'",
