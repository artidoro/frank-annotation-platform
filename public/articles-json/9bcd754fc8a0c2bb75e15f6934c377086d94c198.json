A group called Community Technology Alliance is giving away free Google handsets which come loaded with apps that help the homeless find shelters, soup kitchens, and warn of severe weather. The phones are also designed to help people apply for jobs and find housing, as companies often require people to visit their websites. Holly Leonard (left), who was homeless and had spent time in prison, now has a house after finding an advert on Craigslist using a Google phone she was given to allow her to get online Holly Leonard, a homeless woman from San Francisco who has spent time in jail and in a women's refuge, has used her free handset to find herself a new home in San Jose, with her husband. She found the advert on Craigslist using a Nexus 5 phone she was given by the Community Technology Alliance. She told the New York Times: 'People don\u2019t put out \"for rent\" signs anymore, so the Internet is the best way. 'You can\u2019t even go get a paper application for a lot of things. You can\u2019t get a job unless you get online. Before I got a free phone, it was like you\u2019re almost nonexistent.' The Bay Area have one of the most acute homelessness problems in the U.S., with approximately destitute 14,000 people living in San Francisco and San Jose alone. While tech companies are keen to promote their image as compassionate businesses, tensions have boiled up over accusations they are not doing enough to help those in their own backyard.
