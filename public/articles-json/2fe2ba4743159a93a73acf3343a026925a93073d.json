    "article": "A youngster has emulated Barcelona star Martin Montoya and scored an audacious 27-yard goal into a basketball hoop - twice. Schoolboy Frankie Franz watched the Spanish right-back pull off the staggering trick shot in a video recorded at Barcelona\u2019s Ciutat Esportiva training ground earlier in the month. The viral clip shows the 23-year-old defender lifting the ball into the net to the sound of gasps from his team mates at the Catalonia club. Joking  that he could do the same with his mum and grandmother, nine-year-old Frankie, who is an academy player with Dagenham and Redbridge Football Club, took to the garden to have a go. He moved the basketball hoop into the middle of the goal and after a little run up sent the ball straight through the net first time. In the video he can be seen turning to face the camera looking absolutely gob-smacked as he places his hands behind his head. A slow motion look at the clip captures the trajectory of the ball, which bounces off the backboard and goes through the hoop below. His mother Lucy, 32, of Upminster, east London, said: \u2018He loves football and after he saw the Barcelona player do the show he said \u2018I\u2019ll be able to do that\u2019. Frankie decided to have a go at the trick shot after watching Barcelona star Martin Montoya pull it off in a video recorded at the club\u2019s Ciutat Esportiva training ground The nine-year-old kicks the ball and sends it straight through the net on the first time of trying just like Spanish right-back Montoya The gob-smacked youngsters places his hands behind his head after scoring while Montoya (right) wheels away in celebration \u2018Me and my mum just said \u2018really?\u2019 and he went to get the net, pulled it over and bang - it went in first time. \u2018Me and mum were like \u2018oh my god\u2019 we couldn\u2019t believe it. \u2018He is very good at football, but that was just amazing. It was very special.\u2019 According to Lucy, although not captured on camera, the youngster had another go immediately after and netted again. \"I think he's got it down now,\" said Lucy, who helps run a building firm with husband Matt, 34. \"He is very confident but you can tell by the look on his face I think he was surprised too.\" The talented young centre midfielder has played football since he could walk and dreams of one day turning out for Real Madrid or Barcelona. The  young centre midfielder is an academy player with Dagenham and Redbridge Football Club and dreams of one day turning out for Real Madrid or Barcelona.",
