The store which is said to be 100 square metre, will be a welcome international addition to the Westfield Miranda shopping centre which currently only stocks leading local labels. The UK brand also promises to deliver over 180 new styles straight from London each week, giving Australian's the opportunity to keep up to date with catwalk trends from overseas, seasons before they would be due to land here. Celebrity charm: British label has asked Cheyenne Tozzi and Nic Westaway to host in the launch celebrations An exclusive limited edition 'Boutique' line will also debut featuring designer collaborations as loved by celebrities such as Cara Delevingne, Beyonce, Kate Moss and Kendall Jenner. The opening of Westfield Miranda is the first of several Topshop and Topman stores to roll out over the next twelve months according to the leading UK brand. This launch marks the seventh Topshop store to open in Australia and closely follows the opening of New Zealand store last month. Fashion flagship: Topshop's flagship store is in Sydney's CBD on the corner of George and Market Street Black is back: London black cabs will escort fashion bloggers to the launch of the Westfield Miranda store The roll out also leads the way for other leading international brands who are set to launch their first Sydney CBD stores including H&M  and Forever 21 who will open in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall later this year. Sydney's current flagship store, which opened in 2012, held a launch party that reportedly cost over $250,000 and was estimated to have over 30,000 people flock through the doors in the first day. If that's anything to go by, it's safe to say the grand opening of the new Westfield Miranda store will be a hit.",
