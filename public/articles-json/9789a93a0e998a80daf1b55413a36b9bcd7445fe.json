Guzan was said to be hurting after missing out on the semi-final victory over Liverpool, but understood Tim Sherwood's decision to keep faith in the competition with the Republic of Ireland goalkeeper. Given's performances in the FA Cup have given Sherwood plenty to consider as the Villa manager looks to pick up the points required to stay in the top-flight, beginning with a trip to Manchester City on Saturday evening. Shay Given celebrates Aston Villa's 2-1 victory against Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzen lost out to Given for the Liverpool clash and is set to lose out again for the final 'Shay comes in every day and trains hard,' said goalkeeping coach Tony Parks. 'He's fully behind Guz when he plays in the league team and he puts pressure on him. If Guz isn't playing well then Shay will be back in the team. 'The reverse comes in the cup. Brad hurts, Brad wants to play at Wembley in the semi-final but like he said to me, it's all about the bigger picture. 'He understands that Shay has earned the right to play in these games and that Shay has earned the right to stay in the team for the Cup final. I don't see that really being a question.' Given's recent performances have given Villa boss Tim Sherwood plenty to ponder overt the coming weeks",
