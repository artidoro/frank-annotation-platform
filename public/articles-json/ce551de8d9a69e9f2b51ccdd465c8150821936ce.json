    "article": "Prince Charles is to name a pub in his designer village Poundbury after the Duchess of Cornwall - it will be built on the centre-piece Queen Mother Square. The inn, which will have 20 bedrooms, is being built in the prince's model village in Dorset as a joint development between the Duchy of Cornwall and brewery Hall & Woodhouse. The estate, which is on his Duchy of Cornwall land near Dorchester, already has a Prince George House. An artist's impression of the pub: The Duchess of Cornwall pub is to be built on Queen Mother Square Prince Charles - seen here in a file picture enjoying a pint with his wife Camilla while touring the country - named the village's centre-piece square after his grandmother and one building after his grandson George Poundbury is Prince Charles' personal 20-year social experiment \u00a0which aims to design and build a perfect, utopian idyll. Inside the estate there is supposed to be no social classes, and schools, shops and places of work are all within a short walking distance. The pub is expected to open early next year. Poundbury already has a pub, The Poet Laureate, but Prince Charles' estate says there is growing demand for another. Anthony Woodhouse, Hall & Woodhouse's managing director, said: 'It's a great privilege to be entrusted by the Duchy to develop this prestigious site. 'Our inn will blend with and mirror Poundbury's architecture and His Royal Highness's vision. '''The Duchess of Cornwall\" is being designed with reference to our flagship site in Bath. 'We are delighted to have received planning permission for 20 beautiful bedrooms above the bar-restaurant for visitors to stay in and use as a base to enjoy Poundbury and Dorset. The new pub named after the Duchess of Cornwall is to be built in Prince Charles' model village Poundbury 'We'll offer a great menu, lovely coffee, tea and cakes and the full range of our Badger cask and bottled beers. Our aim is to provide a community facility for all occasions that both residents and visitors to Poundbury can cherish and enjoy.' Simon Conibear, the Duchy of Cornwall's Estate Director at Poundbury, said: 'The Duchy of Cornwall is very pleased to be entering a joint venture with Hall & Woodhouse, a well-established Dorset Brewer with a high reputation in both brewing and hospitality. 'We have been particularly impressed with their new establishments in Bath, Portishead and Lulworth and believe they can bring the expertise we require for this important building and facility in Queen Mother Square. 'There has been growing demand for both guest rooms and another pub in Poundbury, and we think it will be popular with local businesses, residents and the thousands of people who visit every year.' Construction is underway at the site. The joint venture between between the Duchy of Cornwall and brewery Hall & Woodhouse\u00a0is expected to be complete next year Poundbury is Prince Charles' personal 20-year social experiment which aims to design and build a utopian idyll",
