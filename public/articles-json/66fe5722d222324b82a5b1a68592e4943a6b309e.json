    "article": "Jermain Defoe says his stunning Wear-Tyne derby winner is justification for his decision to quit MLS and return to the Premier League. The former FC Toronto striker had scored just twice for struggling Sunderland since arriving on \u00a380,000-per-week wages in January. But Defoe was the hero on Sunday as his 20-yard volley proved enough to secure a fifth straight victory for the Black Cats over Newcastle. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe believes his stunning volley against Newcastle has proven his worth Defoe's superb first-half strike was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Sunderland in the Wear-Tyne derby Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was completely helpless as Defoe's shot found its way into the top corner The 32-year-old was overcome with emotion in the wake of his brilliant blast, and admits the joy it brought to a sold-out Stadium of Light was too much to take in. 'I have said many times that I missed the Premier League and it's because of games like this,' he said. 'Games like this are why I came back. Being at a club like this, they just love football. I was told before that if I come here and work hard and score goals, they won't ask for anything more. 'And I just love scoring goals, the fans deserved it. It's been really difficult for them in the last few weeks but they always turn out. 'It was the whole occasion really that got to me. It was great to be the person that made so many people happy. I was just thinking, 'Why me?'. 'As the whistle went for half-time and as I was walking down the tunnel I thought, 'I'm crying and I'm on the telly', but I didn't care. For the fans and everyone it was just a special day.' The victory was the first of Dick Advocaat's reign and moved Sunderland up to 15th. Defoe has compared the feeling of scoring the winner against Newcastle to scoring at the World Cup Defoe added: 'The manager said to use beforehand that we were lucky to be playing in a game like this. 'There are so many young kids who wish they could play in a game like this. To be blessed enough and to score the winner is amazing. 'Going on the bus towards the game and seeing everyone outside the hotel, wanting autographs and pictures, there were so many fans there that I felt, 'Wow, this is a massive game'. 'When I scored I got that same feeling as when I scored in the World Cup. I missed the World Cup in 2006 when I felt in my heart I should have gone. 'It hurt me when I didn't go but I went to the next one and when I got the goal (against Slovenia) I was emotional. 'That was scoring in a World Cup for your country. It was the same on Sunday.' Defoe joined Sunderland from MLS side FC Toronoto and feels glad to be back in the Premier League",
