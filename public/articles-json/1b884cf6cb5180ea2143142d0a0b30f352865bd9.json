    "article": "She's been living in New York for a year now, and it seems that Princess Eugenie is right at home in the cosmopolitan city. The 25-year-old cousin of Princes William and Harry was seen texting on her mobile as she navigated the concrete jungle on Thursday. The British royal, who is currently working in New York, showcased her hipster style for the second day in a row wearing a black bowler hat, black leather top and a black and cream miniskirt. Princess Eugenie, who recently turned 25, was engrossed in her phone after indulging in some retail therapy at Intermix in New York Topshop striped zip through skirt Earn your style stripes! Visit site Like the rest of the royals, Princess Eugenie must be counting down the days until the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second baby. But until then, she's busy in the Big Apple! Luckily for our bank balances, Eugenie is a high street gal at heart (apart from the odd shopping spree at Intermix...) and this is the second time this week we've spotted her wearing affordable pieces. Yesterday it was a Zara biker coat, and this time around it's this stripe skirt, which is from Topshop. When teamed with her favorite pork pie hat (also from Topshop) and black ankle boots, she's got city chic sussed! And the good news is that emulating Eugenie couldn't be easier. Just click the link (right) to buy her skirt now, and if (as we predict!) it sells out, shop our edit below. We love the zip front and patch pocket of this Sixties-inspired style, which would look great dressed up with bare legs and heels, or down a la Eugenie with tights and ankle boots.

The young royal completed her look with a pair of Chelsea boots and carried her favourite Rebecca Minkoff quilted handbag. The fashion fan appeared to have snapped up a few purchases, as she carried an Intermix bag. Intermix offers the most sought-after styles from an edited selection of coveted designers. According to the shop's website, within the intimate shopping environment, personal stylists work one-on-one with clients to create looks from designers including Stella McCartney, Proenza Schouler, Missoni, J Brand and Chloe. Princess Eugenie\u00a0showcased her hipster style for the second day in a row wearing a black bowler hat, leather  top and a black and cream miniskirt The fashion fan  carried a shopping tote from Intermix, suggesting she made a few purchases at the store The young royal completed her look with a pair of Chelsea boots and carried her favourite Rebecca Minkoff quilted handbag for the second day in a row On Wednesday, the Princess was seen out and about with a female friend rocking a similar urban chic outfit. At the end of last month, the young royal, who lives three and a half thousand miles away from her family in the UK, celebrated her 25th birthday. In the middle of a Palace function, her father, Prince Andrew, whipped out his iPad and used it to video call his daughter, who currently lives in Manhattan. The shop stocks trendy brands including Stella McCartney, Proenza Schouler, Missoni, J Brand and Chloe If that wasn\u2019t enough, the prince got his 400-strong audience in the State Apartments at St James\u2019s Palace to sing a cheery rendition of Happy Birthday, accompanied by a trumpeter from the Scots Guards. The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James\u2019s Palace, saying: \u2018We are going to do something new this evening. \u2018The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it\u2019s her 25th birthday today.\u2019 Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved. Andrew told her: \u2018You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).\u2019 He then turned to the lance corporal and added: \u2018If you will lead us in Happy Birthday please...\u2019 There were cheers from the crowd as the song came to an end, while plenty of others waved and tried to capture the moment on their camera phones. Eugenie looked delighted and said she was \u2018very proud, Pops\u2019 of her father\u2019s role in the awards, which celebrate innovation and technology in the creative industries. But the singalong did not impress his ex-wife, who joked - in the style of a Eurovision announcement - that the rendition scored \u2018zero points\u2019. The Duke of York holds an iPad as he invites the audience at the Pitch@Palace event to sing happy birthday via FaceTime to his daughter Princess Eugenie Sarah added: \u2018We think you all need to go for choir practice.\u2019 Andrew, however, was content with the gesture. \u2018Having been told this was a bad idea, it worked,\u2019 he said. The Prince, who used a Pitch@Palace event last year to send the first royal selfie, joked: \u2018\u2019What was it somebody said about children and dogs?\u2019 The social media-savy Royal is also the only senior working royal to have his own personal Twitter account. Eugenie has been in New York for the past year, working for an online auction house. Princess  Eugenie of York, pictured with her sister Beatrice at attend The Serpentine Gallery Summer Party last summer, proves she can cut a glamorous figure",
