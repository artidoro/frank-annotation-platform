    "article": "Russia have been awarded a 3-0 walkover victory while Montenegro have been hit with a stadium ban following the abandonment of a fraught Euro 2016 qualifier in Podgorica. UEFA has ordered Montenegro to play its next two qualifying games behind closed doors - with one of those matches suspended for two years - while fining the nation \u00a336,280. During the game, which took place on March 27, Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev was struck by a lit flare. Players from both sides were involved in a brawl before referee decided to abandon the game Fans holding flares cut intimidating figures from the roof of Montenegro's stadium in Podgorica Russia head coach Fabio Capello scratches his head as players leave the pitch after the match is abandoned Play resumed but trouble erupted between the players in the second half and, with further objects coming from the stands, both teams left the field and German referee Deniz Aytekin called the goalless game off after 67 minutes. A statement from European football's governing body read: 'The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) met today and announced the following decision in relation to various incidents that occurred during the European Qualifiers Group G match between Montenegro and Russia, which was played in Podgorica on 27 March. 'The CEDB has decided to declare the above-mentioned match as forfeited. As a consequence, the Football Association of Montenegro (FSCG) is deemed to have lost the game 3-0. A flare, hurled from the stands, hit the Russian keeper on the head in the opening seconds of the game Igor Akinfeev is carried off the pitch on a stretcher, which led to an 30 minute delay before play resumed The keeper was carried off the field to hospital for tests before eventually making a full recovery 'In addition, the FSCG has been ordered to play its next two UEFA competition matches as host association behind closed doors. The second match to be played behind closed doors is deferred for a probationary period of two years. Finally, the association has been fined 50,000 euros.' Russia did not escape unpunished for their players' actions and were issued with a 25,000 euro (\u00a318,143) fine. The head of the Football Association of Montenegro (FSCG) had branded fans who forced the abandonment as 'barbarians'. Montenegro fans light flares from the stands during the Euro 2016 qualifier on March 27 Russian fans voice their displeasure after the game is eventually called off In a statement published on the FSGC's website the day after the game, the association's secretary general Momir Durdevac said: 'The match from the first minute was on the verge of interruption. 'You saw how many people were involved in the organisation, how many times we asked the crowd to refrain from everything. 'But it seems that we do not deserve, neither the country nor the national team, a place in the big competition. Riot police clash with Montenegrin fans after the game is abandoned following a pitch brawl 'They are here to disrupt, they are here to be barbarians. When we play against the great teams and great players, they are here to denounce these players, not to enjoy their skills. 'To interrupt the match, to throw something on the pitch, and then chant: 'Montenegro, I love you' - it is such hypocrisy, it's such primitivism that should not be seen anywhere. 'For me, the game should not have continued after the first minute.'",
