    "article": "A pub landlord who was convicted of drink driving after claiming he was sleepwalking and was not drunk has vowed to never drink again. James Boase, landlord of the Coppa Dolla pub in Broadhempston, Devon had been drinking with a friend in Torquay on March 13, 2014. The 36-year-old publican told Torquay Magistrates' Court that the last thing he could remember was going to bed at approximately 12.30am and then awoke beside his car which had been involved in a car crash. James Boase, pictured, failed to stop after hitting another car on March 13, 2014 near his Devon pub, pictured Mr Boase claimed that he went to bed around 12.30am and must have been sleep walking He insisted he had been 'sleep walking'. However prosecutors insisted he had failed to stop his black Nissan Navara after being involved in a collision with a Citroen Berlingo. Police arrived at Boase's house where they found him standing next to his car. He told the court: 'I remember being confused and slightly frustrated.I honestly don\u2019t know how I got there. 'I remember seeing the car and being completely shocked. I believe I must have gone into my friend\u2019s house and gone to bed. 'At the time I was unaware I had any sort of sleeping disorder. 'There were questions unanswered causing me a lot of problems, I was worried and scared and sought medical help to get some answers.' The court heard how Boase had 75 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, more than double the legal limit. At Torquay Magistrates' Court, District Judge Kevin Grey dismissed Boase\u2019s claims of sleepwalking and found him guilty of drink-driving, failing to stop after an accident, failing to report an accident, and driving dangerously. Boase has been remanded on unconditional bail until May 12 for a pre-sentence report, and was disqualified from driving in the meantime. Boase, who has two previous convictions for drink-driving, said: 'My intention is never to drink again.'",
