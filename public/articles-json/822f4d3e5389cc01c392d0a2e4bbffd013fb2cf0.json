    "article": "Juventus striker Carlos Tevez has refuted claims suggesting he will rejoin Boca Juniors in the summer by insisting he is yet to make a decision on his future. Tevez has said throughout his career that he wanted to end his career at his boyhood club but it appears the Argentine outfit will have to wait for his signature. The 31-year-old's future was thrown into doubt when Boca Juniors president Daniel Angelici claimed he was 'close to bringing Carlos home' despite Tevez having another year on his current deal. Juventus striker Carlos Tevez is yet to make a final decision on his future despite constant links to Boca Talk of a return to his boyhood side intensified when Tevez replicated his famous Boca Juniors celebration Tevez pulled off the 'chicken dance' after scoring a crucial goal during Boca's 2-0 win over River Plate in 2004 And the link was made even stronger over the weekend as Tevez celebrated his strike against Lazio in a similar fashion to when he scored a vital goal for Boca Juniors against River Plate back in 2004. However Tevez has thrown cold water over the 'chicken dance' interpretation by telling Sky Sport Italia: 'That game [against River] does not come into it. 'I celebrated like that because I promised my people that I would and I will do the same if I score against Monaco [on Wednesday]. 'As for my future, enough! It's not right to speak about me. Juve are what count. 'Both Juve and I are going through an extraordinary moment and I'm thinking only of Juve right now. 'I don't know if I will leave. I've not yet decided what to do. 'But it's not right to speak about it now and, as I said, the Bianconeri fans will be the first to know what I decide.'",
