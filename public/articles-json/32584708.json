Italy needs people who don't always say no.\"Critics have accused the 40-year-old former mayor of Florence who became prime minster last year of trying to consolidate his grip on power.They complain that the law awards too much power to single parties, gives party bosses too much scope to select candidates, and denies voters the chance to directly choose representatives. Opposition parties boycotted Monday's vote.Renato Brunetta, parliamentary head of centre-right opposition party Forza Italia, said afterwards that it was \"a very ugly day for our country's democracy\".Mr Renzi wants to further transform the Italian system by abolishing the Senate and replacing it with a non-elected body with lesser powers.Currently, legislation is often held up because identical versions of bills have to be approved by both houses.",
