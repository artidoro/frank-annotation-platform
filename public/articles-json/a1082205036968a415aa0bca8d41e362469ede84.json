    "article": "Bradley Neil admitted he needed to give himself a 'kick up the arse' after missing the cut on his Masters debut at Augusta National. The 19-year-old Scot carded rounds of 78 and 79 to finish 13 over par, although he did at least sign off in style with a birdie on the 18th. 'It was a great learning experience but very tough,' said the 2014 Amateur champion, who played with 1988 Masters winner Sandy Lyle. 'Every time you get to play with the world's best you'll take something away. This is where I want to be in a few years time. I just need to keep working harder. Amateur champion Bradley Neil missed the cut on his debut at the Masters The Scot admitted he needed to 'give himself a kick up the a***' after struggling on the professional tour 'I've prepared well for this but this shows it's not been enough. Sandy was great. Putting is one of the best parts of my game but I struggled with it and he pointed something out and I'll take that on board. 'I'm very jealous of him, he gets to come back (here) every year. That's something I want to do in the future. I think I'm good enough to get back here, I think I have the game to do that. I need to give myself a right kick up the arse after this. I'm desperate to come back.' Neil still harboured hopes of making the cut after his first round, but carded four bogeys, a double bogey and one birdie to cover the front nine in 41, before coming home in 38. 'You know how tough this place is before you get here but any expectations you have are blown out of the water,' he added. 'You don't realise how tough it is until you play it. You watch it so much on TV but you can't believe the difference. Neil was playing with fellow countryman and former Masters winner Sandy Lyle 'It deserves all the respect it gets. It's the best in the world, the toughest in the world. It's been a game of two halves the last few days. It's been taking a step forward and then taking two back. I couldn't get one up on the course, it just kept coming back at me. 'I'm disappointed with the last two days, I've done worse here than I did at the Open (missing the cut on 11 over at Hoylake). 'I thought this would suit me better than the Open. My season has been disappointing so far but I'm playing against world-class fields and bigger, better courses than I was on the amateur circuit. I need to work my socks off. Last year I found it easy on the amateur scene.'",
