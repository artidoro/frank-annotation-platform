    "article": "Technology shows such as the annual E3 games conference in Los Angeles have become known for their scantily clad 'booth babes' designed to attract people to stands. However, a Dutch firm has taken a slightly different approach for its London event. TransIP hired a pair of pole dancing robots for an event in Shoreditch. Scroll down for video The robots were originally created by Walker for a show called 'Peepshow'. The dancers, which cost around \u00a32,500 to hire, were made out of old car parts and were designed by British artist Giles Walker, with their moves controlled by a computer. The robots were originally created in 2012 by Walker for a show called 'Peepshow'. 'We are now all living in a peepshow. 'Continually being watched by mechanical peeping toms on every street corner,' he said. 'With this in mind, I wondered if it was possible to literally make a CCTV camera sexy using simple mechanics...and by using the imagery of a pole dancer question the roles played in voyeurism. The robots will be pole dancing for the remaining four days of the event, along with presentations from leading figures in the technology industry. 'Could this pile of old windscreen wipers and odd pieces of metal become something sexual.... ' 'Inspiration Centraal' - the free event hosted by Dutch hosting company TransIP - has so far seen more than 3,500 technology enthusiasts attend to hear talks from some of London's most successful startup entrepreneurs, including MindCandy founder Michael Acton-Smith and 'gaming industry godfather' Ian Livingstone. The eight day event, was been staged to celebrate the UK launch of Dutch VPS, hosting and domain name company TransIP. The dancers, which cost around \u00a32,500 to hire, were made out of old car parts and were designed by British artist Giles Walker , with their moves controlled by a computer. 'We chose Shoreditch and Tech City quite deliberately as our new home, as we are a fan of London's growing stature as an international technology hub, but frankly our expectations have been exceeded by the level of engagement we've experienced from the startup community in this beautiful city,' said TransIP CEO Jeroen H\u00fcpscher. 'We've been blown away by the reaction to our event, the level of attendance and the infectious enthusiasm for building a vibrant and successful startup ecosystem. The robots will be pole dancing for the remaining four days of the event, along with presentations from leading figures in the technology industry.",
