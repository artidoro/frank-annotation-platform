    "article": "The Indiana Pacers' Chris Copeland and his wife were stabbed during an early-morning argument after they left a popular New York club  on Wednesday, according to reports. Copeland, 31, and his wife, Katrine Saltare, 28, were talking in the street just before 4am when a 22-year-old man, Shezoy Bleary, interrupted them,  the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0reported. When Copeland, who used to play for the New York Knicks, told the man to back off, the suspect allegedly pulled out a knife and plunged it into the athlete's abdomen and elbow. He then turned on Saltare, stabbing her in the breast, buttocks and arm, sources told the Post. Scroll down for video Injured: Chris Copeland, a player for the Indiana Pacers, and his wife, Katrine Saltare, pictured, were both stabbed following an argument outside a New York City club early on Wednesday Cuffed: Pero Antic, who plays for the Atlanta Hawks, was arrested for failing to clear the scene for police and he is seen being escorted out of the 10th Precinct of the NYPD on Wednesday Arrest: Another Hawks player, Thabo Sefolosha, was also arrested and can be seen leaving the station A video shared with TMZ shows the victims on the sidewalk as they are attended to by emergency responders. 'We were both stabbed,' Saltare can be heard saying. 'We were attacked out of nowhere by a f***ing black civilian. We have nothing to say. We are scared for our lives!' Another woman, Catherine Somani, 23, was also stabbed in the abdomen as she apparently tried to break up the fight,\u00a0WABC reported. She knew the attacker. Murdock, from Brooklyn, was arrested at the scene along with two fellow NBA players, Pero Anti\u0107 and Thabo Sefolosha of the Atlanta Hawks. The players allegedly obstructed the crime scene as police arrived by refusing to get out of the way, according to sources. Authorities recovered a knife from the scene, sources told the New York Daily News. Copeland and his wife were both listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital, while Somani was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital. Their injuries are not thought to be life threatening. Injured: Video by a passerby shows Copeland and his wife on the ground before they were taken to hospital Scene: The couple was stabbed by a man who interrupted them as they argued outside 1OAK in Chelsea Bloody scene: After Copeland reportedly told the man to back off, he pulled out a knife and stabbed them Blood-splattered: A nearby car, which belongs to Copeland, has streaks of blood across it after the attack Probe:\u00a0NYPD officers search for evidence outside the 1Oak nightclub in Chelsea in New York City CBS reported that Copeland underwent surgery on Wednesday morning. 'We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City,' Indiana Pacers President Larry Bird said in a statement to DailyMail.com on Wednesday. 'We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured.' The team confirmed that he had suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen. The fight broke out down the street from 1OAK, a popular Chelsea club where celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and Lindsay Lohan have been spotted partying. The couple is believed to have only been inside the club briefly. The Hawks and Pacers are both in New York for basketball games. Together: The couple, pictured, was rushed to Bellevue hospital where they are in stable condition Loved up: The couple are seen in a picture taken after their engagement in September 2013 Copeland, who is from New Jersey, was supposed to play his former team, the New York Knicks, at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. He previously played 56 games for the team in his 2012-2013 rookie season. Both Pacers and Knicks fans flocked to social media to wish him a speedy recovery on Wednesday. 'Hope that you and your wife have a speedy recovery,' one fan wrote. 'Once a knick always a knick.' The Hawks will take on the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center, but it is not yet clear if the two arrested players will be available to play. 'We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning,' Hawks spokesperson Garin Narain told DailyMail.com on Wednesday. 'We are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time.' On the court: Copeland previously played for the New York Knicks (pictured in 2013).
