    "article": "They played in grey and duly put in a dull and uninspired performance, these really are dark days for Newcastle United. Still, at least they returned a club record profit of \u00a318.7million last week and retail gain was probably behind the bizarre decision to ditch their black-and-white stripes. But on Sunday they set another record as losers of the last five Tyne-Wear derbies. John Carver looks on as his Newcastle United struggle against rivals Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby Head coach John Carver said before the game he had a secret motivational tactic up his sleeve and would only reveal what it was following victory. Well, we'll never know what he used in a forlorn attempt to rouse his players. But we do know it didn't work. Phil Neville was scathing in his assessment of Newcastle a fortnight ago when he said that their application during the 3-0 defeat at Everton was reminiscent of a set of players with one eye on their summer holidays. Neville was at the Stadium of Light on Sunday and, rather than prove him wrong as a livid Carver promised his men would, they played like a side with their flip-flops on. Carver was in a rage again on Sunday night, but this time it was his players feeling the fury. 'I said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not working hard enough. I was wrong,' he said. Jordi Gomez and Remy Cabella do battle on the Stadium of Light pitch as Sunderland snatch victory 'The performance hurts more than the result. We were second best. It's a funny thing pressure, some players can handle it and some can't. Some of ours perhaps can't after losing five in a row. 'I am absolutely embarrassed to be part of it.' Newcastle's problem is a sad attitude of acceptance that has been allowed to permeate a squad lacking in ability and character. The Magpie mandate is survival and, to that end, their season finished the minute they were more or less assured of as much. Not even a derby can rally this lot. There was one incident in the second half which captured their passive approach. With the play dead, Mike Williamson had to scream at team-mate Daryl Janmaat in a desperate effort to return the ball with some sense of urgency. Sunderland, in contrast, hassled, harried and hounded their opponents. They had won the previous four derbies because they out-worked Newcastle and wanted it more. They won a fifth for exactly the same reasons. Jermain Defoe earns Sunderland all three points with a sensational volley at the Stadium of Light This was billed as 'The Desperation Derby' given the alarming form of the North-East rivals going into the game \u2013 four goals between them in 18 hours with six points taken from a possible 36. But there was only one team desperate to win this. It wasn't until the final 15 minutes that Newcastle drew a save from Costel Pantilimon. But it was too little, too late. Far too little, in fact. These are dispiriting times on Tyneside. The disconnect between supporters, players and hierarchy has never been greater. On full-time, the Toon Army spat as much venom towards their own team as they did the red-and-whites goading them nearby. They had just witnessed a dour display of nothingness, sadly lacking in energy, imagination and pride. Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul can only look on in horror as the striker's effort cruises in There was one shining light amid the darkness. Cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez was starting his first game in 20 months and was by some distance the only player in grey worthy of applause, and that he rightly received. His shirt was soaked near-enough black come the end such was his effort. It failed, however, to inspire his team-mates, one of which, Tim Krul, was criticised by fans on social media when it appeared he congratulated Jermain Defoe for his stunning match-winner shortly before half-time. But to demonise Krul alone would be wrong. The problems at Newcastle run from top to bottom. They are a club without ambition, happy to renew their Premier League pay packet come the end of the season. That message from above means you end up with performances such as this \u2013 grey, with little sign of light.
