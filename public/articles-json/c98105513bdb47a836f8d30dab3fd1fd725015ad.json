    "article": "Glasgow Warriors have confirmed that experienced duo Al Kellock and Dougie Hall will both start Friday night's Guinness PRO12 match with Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun. Both skipper Kellock and Hall - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of May and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers. And while Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was naming his full squad for the Blues match on Thursday, he announced that the second-row and hooker would start in the pack against the Welsh outfit. Glasgow Warriors veteran Al Kellock will start at lock against Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night The encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and, in a nice touch by the club, the match ball will be presented by Kellock's dad and Hall's mum along with Alistair Johnson, who was Kellock's best man, and Bernie Mitchell, who was an inspirational figure for Hall coming through at Hillhead/Jordanhill. Having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 Scotland caps, Hall admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign. 'You get to a point where you start thinking to yourself 'this could be the last game of rugby I ever play' so you want to make the most of it,' the 34-year-old said. 'I really want to enjoy these last few games, but also stay focused and help the Warriors secure a play-off place and hopefully the trophy. Glasgow hooker Dougie Hall is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby As retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game. You start to think about your last team huddle, the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that I will miss incredibly.' Since he first played in the equivalent of the PRO12 for Edinburgh Rugby back in 2002/03 Hall has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly. As a result, despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table, he does not expect an easy night, far from it. 'They have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year,' he explained. 'We really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play-offs in the coming weeks. 'I hope that gone are the days when the PRO12 is looked on as a lesser league, the teams and the talent involved now really is top class.' Gregor Townsend's Glasgow side are currently top of the Pro12 standings ahead of Cardiff's visit This season Hall has been restricted to seven appearances in the PRO12 for the Warriors to date, Fraser Brown and Pat MacArthur playing the majority of minutes with Kevin Bryce also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey. And while Hall himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio, he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run-in and in the play-offs. 'The last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym,' Hall explained. 'For me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field I can give it everything. 'As you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group, but I like to think I have acted like that since I came to the Warriors in 2007. Wales prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for Cardiff as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain 'I was the starting hooker for a number of years and as Pat, and more recently, Fraser and Kevin have come in I hope they have learnt from watching what I do and also have learnt from what I say too.' Meanwhile, Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match with a calf strain. The injury forced the Wales and British & Irish Lions' man off last week in his side's European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat to the Dragons. 'Gethin has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought. He hasn't trained this week so is a doubt, but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season,' Blues attack coach Paul John said. 'We want to play to a game plan, execute well and perform to the best of our ability. To do justice to the league we have to do that. 'Glasgow are a good offloading side, they are a complete side in many ways, and we've got to control the ball better than we did last weekend.'",
