    "article": "These incredible photos are about as close to an adult version of Where's Wally as you can get. Blended into the background, these models are difficult to tell apart from their surroundings. Camouflaged in body paint, women pose for the camera against a backdrop of overgrown woodland. A series of pictures by German artist J\u00f6rg D\u00fcsterwald show body-painted models camouflaged in woodland In many of the pictures, the intricate detailing of the paint on the naked bodies means it is virtually impossible to determine where the person is. The jaw-dropping artwork is the brainchild of\u00a0J\u00f6rg D\u00fcsterwald, a 49-year-old artist and bodypainter from Hameln, Germany. J\u00f6rg\u00a0has been actively producing body art projects for the last 20 years and uses his body-painting skills in a range of creative projects including advertising, corporate events, and TV marketing campaigns. His work has featured in several art magazines and in 2008 he was awarded the German brush-painting champion at a national competition. The artist places the model next to a tree half-painted and then adds the details to make her blend into the environment Some of the models are so well camouflaged that it is impossible to work out where they are The artist is a well-renowned body painter who has used his skills in TV adverts The photoshoots, which take several hours to complete are heavily planned before the artist arrives at the location with the model. The pre-painted model is then placed against an item like a tree or a mossy log and then\u00a0J\u00f6rg adds details that will help to camouflage her using his portable paint kit. As well as his recent forest shoot in Brullsen, Germany, which took place earlier this week,\u00a0J\u00f6rg has also painted models into a number of other backdrops. They include\u00a0mechanic\u00a0garages, music shops and fishing ports. The women are required to lie still for long periods of time so that they can be painted into the background and the photographed J\u00f6rg has also painted models into a number of other backdrops, including \u00a0include mechanic garages, music shops and fishing ports.",
