    "article": "An obscure agreement struck by state governments in 1993 means the vast majority of Australians will not get a day off this Anzac weekend. Under the pact, no public holiday is triggered when\u00a0Anzac Day falls on a Saturday, as it does this year. The agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation. That makes Anzac Day the exception when it comes to public holidays. If Easter, Christmas, Australia Day, the Queen's Birthday or Labour Day fall on a weekend, a holiday is granted on a weekday. Scroll down for video Bosses in some states have been warned to expect a rise in employees calling in sick this Monday due to the lack of an Anzac Day public holiday But the rules do not apply to everyone, it seems. Western Australia and some public servants in Canberra have decided to go it alone and will get Monday off. The head of the Immgration Department declared Monday a public holiday for 8,500 staff, but other departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Defence will have to turn up to work. For the rest of the country, it's back to work on Monday. The decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert Paul Dundon warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel 'entitled' to the day off, reports\u00a0Courier Mail. 'Employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off, Australians have an entitlement mentality,' said Mr Dundon, the boss of Direct Health Solutions. 'They're missing out and people want their fair share.' Mr Dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent-25 per cent rise in absenteeism on Monday 27. In turn, some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day, they risk losing their job. In Queensland alone, losses to businesses are estimated at more than $7.5 million if an expected 20,000 workers call in sick. The anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli has fallen on a Saturday this year, meaning all states but WA will miss out on holiday on Monday Australian state governments came together for a Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation. The reason was to avoid 'costs and disruption for business' that occurred when every state had different laws. The states agreed that when Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day fell on a weekend, a public holiday the next working day would be triggered. It was decided that a public holiday for Anzac Day would only be triggered if it fell on a Monday Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday would continue to be observed on the days set according to tradition across the nation. In NSW, the Greens called on Premier Mike Baird to give workers Monday off, claiming the government has the power to grant an additional holiday under the Public Holidays Act. But NSW Business Chamber chief officer Stephen Cartwright told The\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald\u00a0there is no need for another holiday. 'Anzac Day is a very special day for Australians as it commemorates the landings at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915, and we rightly pause and take time to reflect on that day, whatever day of the week it happens to fall on each year,' he said. Punters playing traditional Australian Anzac Day gambling game two-up: NSW Business Chamber officer Stephen Cartwright said there is no need for an additional holiday on for Anzac Day The last time Anzac Day fell on a Saturday was 2009, and before that in 1987, 1992 and 1998. A survey released last year by Direct Health Solutions found Australian employees took on average of 10 sick days per year. It estimated that Australia experiences an annual cost of $33 billion in lost productivity from sick days.",
