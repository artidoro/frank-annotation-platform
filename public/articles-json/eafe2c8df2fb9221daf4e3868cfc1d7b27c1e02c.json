    "article": "A 20-year-old British tourist has claimed she was molested by a taxi driver in Jaipur, who has now been arrested (pictured posed by model) A taxi driver in India has been arrested after being accused of molesting a British tourist. The driver, known as Salim, is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in Jaipur on Friday evening. The man, from Todabhim in Karauli district of Rajasthan, is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody. A spokesman for Rajasthan Police said they had taken statements from the woman and her friend, India Times reported. 'We have arrested taxi driver Salim on a complaint filed by a British tourist on early Saturday.' said the man. 'He was arrested under Section 354 of IPC (Indian Penal Code). He was sent to judicial custody,' His arrest follows a number of incidents reported to have taken place in India against tourists and locals, which have led to widespread protests. On February 8 a Japanese tourist filed a complaint accusing a tout of raping her in Dudu, around 60km away from Jaipur. The woman had been on a tour when the man allegedly approached her and offered his service as a guide. In March a 75-year-old Indian nun was gang raped by a group of eight robbers when she confronted them after they broke in to the\u00a0Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal state's Nadia district. There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times. Later Nagaland Government said he was innocent.",
