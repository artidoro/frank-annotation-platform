    "article": "Famed for phenomenal cuisine, majestic rural landscapes and vibrant cities, Vietnam offers an undisputed sensory overload. But there's one sight the becomes most engrained in the memories of even the most seasoned traveller - the wacky things people carry on the back of a motorbike or scooter. Lee Thompson's seen plenty in his 14 years as an award-winning photojournalist covering the civil war in Libya, the revolution in Egypt, the tsunami in Japan and other extensive travels before he co-founded The Flash Pack, a small group flashpacking tour company. But even he repeatedly marvels at what the men and women of southeast Asia can balance and transport on just a scooter or a beaten up old motorcycle, and on one of his company's\u00a0Vietnam & Cambodia\u00a0tours with a group of nine this month he was compelled to capture some of the finest. There's seemingly no measure to what can be packed onto the back of a bike or scooter in southeast Asia The Flash Pack's Lee Thompson captured this man with scores of live chickens in weaved baskets this month in Sapa, Vietnam That's one way to pop a wheelie! A man pulls a packed trailer from a loading dock at the Mekong river crossing in Vietnam with a motorbike In this series of images from a single 14-day trip, he photographs a man casually puffing on a cigarette and carrying what looks like more than 20 live chickens in woven cages perched on the back of his scooter\u00a0in Sapa, Vietnam. At a Mekong river crossing in Vietnam he is there to watch a motorcyclist dragging a massive trailer out of a boat loading dock on a bike, with the load so heavy he continuously pops wheelies, all the while not in the slightest bit bothered his two wheels have become one. Thompson enjoys the fact that what looks quirky to a Brit is simply every day life for the locals. In Vietnam alone there are more than 37 million motorbikes or scooters, most definitely the vehicle of choice in traffic that would make western country's peak hours look tame. 'Unlike other tour companies we venture in to remote parts of Sapa where it's not unusual to see bikes carrying livestock like chickens, pigs and goats - it makes really great photographs but it's just a way of life for the locals,' said Thompson. In Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, all that's needed to move some large piles of chairs is two wheels and some clever  packing Getting around on two wheels is a way of life in Vietnam where there are more than 37 million motorbikes (and only a few million cars) 'I watched as one of the bikers tried to work out how he would carry eight goats on his bike, he fell three times before he finally got going and the goats didn't seem to happy about it!' A family of five and a smiling group of four adults pile onto scooters to get from A to B while another transport a giant pile of chairs stacked on a tray from one side of the city to the other with the power of just his humble two-wheeler. With limited resources comes innovation, as is evident with one mother who has attached a cane high chair to the front of her vehicle to make it more comfortable for her to transport her toddler around town in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 'Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh are full of bikes and it makes the morning commute in London seem easy,' Thompson said. 'Even though most of our group was very well travelled the amount of bikes on the road still comes as a shock in these amazing countries - it's crazy!' A mother fits a high chair is onto the front of a scooter for her toddler in this shot captured in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam A bike that's seen better days carrying pigs is not an unusual sight on the road to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, says Thompson A family drive is a cosy affair for this five-some packed onto a scooter  in Hanoi The man on the back of this scooter in Hanoi, Vietnam, holds a ladder and some building materials as they weave their way through traffic Thompson says the eight goats in the cage on the back on this bike 'didn't seem happy' as the rider tipped them over three times The commute in Vietnam makes the daily battle on the Tube that Londoners endure look easy, but they don't seem to mind The morning commute in Ho Chi Minh City is certainly less stuffy than piling into the Tube on a Monday morning And here are some more unique uses for scooters... An assortment of exotic fish are in bags and ready for sale, cleverly attached to this man's scooter, in H\u1ea1 Long Bay, Vietnam A basket vendor balances an array of products on the back of this small motorised bike in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam There's only one way to transport a bike that isn't working in Vietnam ... on the back of one of the country's 37 million bikes or scooters",
