They also arrested her boyfriend, Ryan Lambert, who allegedly told officers he was to be paid $11,000 (\u00c2\u00a37,270) to drive the drugs to San Francisco.Ms Henifin told agents they had been monitoring police radio communication on a mobile phone when they heard a report of a shooting and left the area, according to the complaint.The three defendants in US custody face conspiracy as well as drug possession and distribution charges.The wooded area a few miles east of a highway border crossing is a well-known smuggling route for drugs and firearms, and a spokeswoman for the US attorney for the Western District of Washington told the BBC smuggling prosecutions are \"a large part of our practice\".",
