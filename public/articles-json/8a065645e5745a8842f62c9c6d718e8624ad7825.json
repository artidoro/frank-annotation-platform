    "article": "Every country in the world may have its rich kids of Instagram, but in Mexico the increasingly ostentatious displays of wealth by the young elite is taking on a political dimension. In a country where a significant majority of citizens live in poverty, the self-styled Mirreyes (my kings), with their champagne and sports cars, are increasingly exposing the amount of wealth concentrated into a relatively small number of hands. Mirreyes, which refers to individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' and are 'placed above all others', post pictures of luxuries with a hashtag of the same name. Scroll down for video Ballers and shotcallers: Mirreyes are often the sons and daughters of the members of Mexican high society Laying out and living it up: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes showcase luxurious vacation spots It's just one big fiesta: A glance through the social media profile of a Mirrey often reveals a party picture Bling: Good clothes, nice watches and a flashy style are almost prerequisites for becoming one of the Mirreyes Ready for takeoff: An expert on the subject of Mirreyes said 'the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts' Three for the money:\u00a0Mirreyes' displays of wealth can  lead to political and legal advantages down the road They are often the sons and daughters of government officials, wealthy businessman and other members of Mexican high society and although their displays of wealth can be embarrassing, they can also lead to political and legal advantages,\u00a0Maclean's\u00a0reported. One such individual, the eldest son of then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a cruise ship off the coast of Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and vanished without a trace, Before he jumped off the ship's 15th floor and disappeared beneath the waves, 29-year-old Jorge Alberto L\u00f3pez Amores told his friends to take cellphone videos of his leap. He said: 'I'll stop this cruise, I'll make history.' L\u00f3pez got his wish as the boat stopped for two hours to search for him, according to Vivelo Hoy. His story is not the only example of the celebration of excess gone wrong. In 2012, the\u00a0daughter of oil workers' union boss Carlos Romero Deschamps was brought into the spotlight for posting photos of her luxury lifestyle, including Gucci bags and expensive wine, on Facebook. Her flashy pictures did not sit well in a country where people work an average of 2 226 hours a year and households take in an average of $12,850 per year after taxes. Their stories are just examples of what the author of a book about Mirreyes called the Mexican 'Generation Me'. Keeping time: People often post pictures of watches and other luxuries like designer bags and or alcohol Rought: In Mexico, the images of wealth are shocking as households take in an average of $12,850 per year Symbol: Jorge Alberto L\u00f3pez Amores (right), who likely died after jumping off a boat, is an example of a Mirrey Purchasing power: Mirreyes might not even think twice about spending hundreds of dollars on a stuffed bear Selfie star: L\u00f3pez, the son of\u00a0then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a yacht in 2014 No need to pimp my ride: Mirreyes obtain cash from sources like inheritance, theft, corruption or the lottery Kiss the bling: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes will either have a shiny watch, fancy champagne, or both The author of Mirreynato, the Other Inequality,\u00a0Ricardo Raphael, wrote in his book: 'The economic wealth Mirreyes use is the main marker of class. 'No matter where the money comes - work, inheritance, theft, corruption or lottery- the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts'. By identifying themselves as Mirreyes on social media, these seemingly spoiled brats are possibly creating connections which could be important for business and politics in the future because money attracts powerful friends. They are certainly being noticed. In 2011, a \u00a0a website called Mirrreybook was created by Pepe Ceballos. He began posting photos of mMirreyes on the site and it quickly became popular. Ceballos said: 'Mirreyes, who don't have anything to do with narcos [narcotics traffickers], seem like they're competing with them to see who has more. 'We've suddenly seen it in the kind of fashion or the bling-bling. There's more influence from the narcos.' In a recent source of embarrassment, Mirreyes were also featured in a controversial video that showcased the class of 2015 from private school Instituto Cumbres in Mexico City. In the professionally-produced video, well-dressed male students were shown drinking alcohol while carrying out a casting call with young women who dance, strip and wash their feet. Popping bottles: Mirreyes are individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' The flash and the not-so-furious: Members of this select group seem to have few reasons to be upset with life Up in smoke: Some Mirreyes post photos implying they have something in common with narcotics traffickers Look at me: The selfie has become somewhat of a status symbol and Mirreyes frequently use them to show off Future endeavors:\u00a0By identifying themselves on social media, Mirreyes are possibly creating good connections The all-male  Catholic school was accused of sexism and promoting privilege after the video began to spread across the internet, according to the\u00a0National Catholic Reporter. The school issued an apology late last month. It said: 'The Cumbres Institute Mexico asks for an apology for the content of the video that offended various persons, who have expressed anger. 'This video in no way represents the values and principles of the school, students, families and graduates. ''The necessary measures are being taken with the students involved and to establish rules so that it does not occur again.' Permanent vacation It seems Mirreyes\u00a0travel frequently to foreign destinations judging by the photos they post Power: Mirreyes could be important for business and politics in the future because cash attracts friends Ouch: Pics of Mirreyes relaxing don't sit well in a country where people work an average of 2 226 hours a year",
