The England international was replaced by Robin van Persie in the closing stages of the Premier League clash and was seen receiving treatment on the bench. And Van Gaal confirmed to MUTV after the game that Rooney had sustained the injury but that it was too early to know the severity. Wayne Rooney winces after injuring his knee during the defeat by Everton at Goodison Park Rooney waits on the touchline to be replaced by Robin van Persie in the 88th minute West Brom (home) - May 2 Crystal Palace (away) - May 9 Arsenal (home) - May 16 Hull (away) - May 24 'We have to wait and see how heavy (serious) it is,' the United boss said. United suffered back-to-back league defeats for the first time since Van Gaal took over as Everton climbed into the top half. James McCarthy and John Stones gave the home side a commanding lead at half-time before substitute Kevin Mirallas completed the rout. The defeat leaves United fourth in the race for automatic Champions League qualification and a miserable afternoon was compounded further by the Rooney injury. Van Gaal fears the defeat has allowed Liverpool to apply pressure to United in the race for fourth Rooney looks in pain after taking a knock before being replaced in the closing stages Rooney grimaces as he sits on the bench after being taken off following the injury",
