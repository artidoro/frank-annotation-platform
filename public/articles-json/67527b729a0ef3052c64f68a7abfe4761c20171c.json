The quaint capital city put on one hell of a show last weekend for its inaugural CubaDupa festival \u2013 a colourful party that shut down streets and spanned several blocks. Scroll down for video The wacky and delightful Electric Groove Rider stormed down Wellington's Cuba Street at the weekend for the city's inaugural\u00a0CubaDupa festival \u2013 a colourful party that shut down streets and spanned several blocks Wellington Batucada \u2013 a community-based percussion group \u2013 brought the flamboyant world of samba to Cuba Street with late night revellers eager to be part of the dancing street party unfolding Wellington\u2019s iconic and bohemian Cuba Street was the centre point of all activity and drew in thousands of locals and tourists for the contagious and frenetic festivities. The massive scale festival \u2013 the first of its kind in several years - saw lively street performances, circus acts taking over parks, performers dancing in shop windows and music stretching across the corners of the city. Performers dressed in outrageously outlandish costumes strolled casually through the nooks and crannies of CubaDupa just like the average-dressed tourist. CubaDupa transformed everyday parking blocks into stages across the Cuba Street precinct, with more than 100 different performances scheduled over the weekend.

As the rain started to fall on Saturday afternoon, Brazilian-style drumming group Sambatron led the crowd in an energised dance procession down the main street. The party continued with Wellington\u2019s Cuban salsa specialists, Cuban Fusion and Cuban Quartet Calle Cuba, hosting a dance class that drew in the young and old for a large scale conga line. No one even batted an eyelid as revellers spontaneously broke out into a dance at the first sound of a beating drum or trumpet. Wellington\u2019s iconic and bohemian Cuba Street was the centre point of all activity and drew in thousands of locals and tourists for the contagious and frenetic festivities Many craned their necks to catch a glimpse of Spanish street performers Osadia creating wacky hairstyles straight out of The Hunger Games Not even the rain could dampen the carnival spirit with thousands soaking up the party vibes along the Cuba Street precinct The massive scale festival \u2013 the first of its kind in several years - saw lively street performances, circus acts taking over parks, performers dancing in shop windows and music stretching across the corners of the city The punk costumed, theatrical dancers that make up the wacky and delightful Electric Groove Rider was a huge drawcard as performers made their way up and down the street in a unique pedal powered mobile sound system. A flashmob took over a circus-themed carpark with children and even the elderly invited to take part as they performed a hilarious mashup of the Kiwi classic Poi E and Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller. Wellington Batucada \u2013 a community-based percussion group \u2013 brought the flamboyant world of samba to Cuba Street with late night revellers eager to be part of the dancing street party that quickly unfolded. But it wasn\u2019t just the musical and dance performances that had everyone on their feet. Many craned their necks to catch a glimpse of Spanish street performers Osadia creating wacky hairstyles straight out of The Hunger Games. Various performers took to Wellington's Cuba Street in an array of culture and colour over Saturday and Sunday Unicorn Roxy Coervers and princess Courtney L'Amour were among the festival-goers dressed to impress Culture was at the heart of CubaDupa with traditional dances and costumes a highlight of the event Circus acts twirled from suspending ropes and hoops in what would have been just a regular carpark on any other day Cuba Street is regularly a hub for entertainment and food, so it\u2019s no wonder the varying eclectic tastes were on show in true street festival style. Wellington is said to have more bars, restaurants and cafes per capita than New York \u2013 and they were certainly out in force during CubaDupa. More than 60 vendors were on hand on Saturday to serve food on the street, with many eateries setting up stalls outside their shops to draw people in. On Sunday, Cuba Street was transformed into a massive outdoor caf\u00e9 with resident eateries including Scopa, Ombra and Mattherhorn setting up tables on the street for the hungry festival-goers. CubaDupa, which is a retake on the former Cuba Street Carnival, is said to have cost about $500,000 to put on and will be funded for the next five years. Daily Mail Australia was at CubaDupa as a guest of Positively Wellington Tourism.
