    "article": "Alec Stewart has expressed his interest in becoming the new Director of England Cricket following the sacking on Wednesday of Managing Director Paul Downton. Stewart, who played in a record 133 Tests for England and is currently director of cricket at Surrey, has not yet been approached by the ECB. But he said: \u2018When England come calling, you shouldn\u2019t say no.\u2019 The early bookies\u2019 favourite for the post is Michael Vaughan, the former England captain who is close to the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, and has also made clear his desire to help English cricket out of its current state of chaos. Alec Stewart stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday Stewart lines up with Surrey players for the team photo at the KIA Oval Test matches: 133 Highest score: 190 Runs: 8463 Centuries: 15 Half-centuries: 45 Batting average: 39.54 Stumpings: 14 First test: West Indies, Kingston, Feb 24, '90 Last test:\u00a0South Africa, The Oval, Sep 4, '03 Stats via ESPNcricinfo But Stewart, who also spoke highly of the early impression Kevin Pietersen has made on his return to the Surrey team, remains a respected figure in the game. And he is open to offers. Asked whether he\u2019d be interested in the post \u2013 created by the ECB\u2019s new chief executive Tom Harrison, who confirmed Downton\u2019s demise Wednesday evening \u2013 Stewart said: \u2018I can\u2019t just say yes until I know what the role and the responsibility are. But, of course, if it was the right role, you\u2019d be stupid not to look at it. \u2018As a player I did just about anything that was asked of me. If they asked me to take on a role, and it\u2019s the right role, of course I\u2019d listen and have a big conversation \u2013 once the ECB have asked Surrey permission to speak to me, of course, because I\u2019m under contract here. \u2018I just want England to be the best side in the world. And if the ECB felt I was the right person to help take them to No 1, then of course I\u2019d look at it. \u2018I\u2019ve got a big job here, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m concentrating on. But at the same time you\u2019ve got to make yourself aware of other opportunities, and when England come calling, you shouldn\u2019t say no. \u2018If they want someone with experience of being a director of cricket, then I\u2019d have thought I\u2019d be very close to being at the top of that list.\u2019 Stewart (centre front) poses in the Surrey team photo ahead of the start of the County Championship season Stewart was a wicketkeeper-batsman for England. Here he looks on as Australia's Steve Waugh plays a shot towards England fielder Graham Thorpe in the fifth test of an Ashes clash at Edgbaston in 1993 Stewart is carried by team-mates Steve Harmison (left) and Andrew Flintoff, after playing his final Test match, at the Oval in September 2003 against South Africa But Stewart made clear he\u2019d be interested in the job only if there was a clear definition of his accountability. \u2018If you do well, you get patted on the back, if you don\u2019t do well, you get moved on. To me, it\u2019s straightforward. But if there are too many bits and pieces in the jigsaw, people can hide. \u2018I\u2019m not one for hiding. It\u2019s about making tough decisions, and living and dying by those decisions. And making sure the players play without fear.\u2019 Stewart, who led England in 15 Tests and scored nearly 8,500 runs, was effusive in his praise of Pietersen, whose chances of a surprise England recall increased from highly unlikely to merely improbable following the sacking of Downton \u2013 who in turn had sacked Pietersen over a year ago. Kevin Pietersen will feature for Stewart's Surrey outfit in this year's county championships and the former wicket-keeper batsman believes the 34-year-old could still make a comeback at international level \u2018We\u2019ve never had a problem with him,\u2019 said Stewart. \u2018I\u2019m sure other dressing-rooms may not say the same, but we don\u2019t have to handle him. \u2018He fits in well. When he walked in, he went to his locker straightaway: it was like he\u2019d never been away. We can only speak in glowing terms of him. And that\u2019s how I judge people, is how I find them \u2013 not hearsay, or from other people. \u2018England have said he\u2019s not on their radar. But you should never say never. If he\u2019s racking the runs up, and England are struggling, if the players aren\u2019t getting runs or there\u2019s an injury to a batsman, and he\u2019s in top form \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t you want to bring him back?\u2019",
