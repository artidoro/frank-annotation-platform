    "article": "Promposals are the big trend in high school proms as teens think up progressively more outlandish ways to ask each other to the biggest dance of the year. They are so big, in fact, that students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual, according to a new survey. With budgets for outfits, flowers, transportation, food and other sundries at around $1,000 for the average American high schooler, that means most intend to spend $324 on the once-simple query: Will you go to prom with me? Pricey promposals: Students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual of promposals, according to a survey of 3,000 people conducted by Visa That's according to a survey from Visa, which asked 3,000 people aged 18 or older what they expected to shell out for the prom and on what. For a primer on promposals, see previous years' winners of most outrageous (and viral) prom proposals. In 2012, Matthew Ho from Toronto promposed to his girlfriend, Tina, with 1,500 pink helium balloons and a sign that read, 'Tina, will you go to prom with me?' His stunt attracted a crowd in the hallway, giving the blindfolded Tina an audience when the stunt was finally revealed. It's unclear what the cost of these hockey pucks was, but the average American high schooler could spend over $300 just asking his or her date to the yearly dance In 2012, Matthew Ho from Toronto promposed to his girlfriend, Tina, with 1,500 pink helium balloons and a sign that read, 'Tina, will you go to prom with me?' His stunt attracted a crowd in the hallway, giving the blindfolded Tina an audience when the stunt was finally revealed Some students have even rented plane banners to pop the prom question - at a starting cost of $1,000 in the New York area. 'It started last year \u2014 I've been in the business six years, and we had never sold a prom banner before then,' explained Remy Colin of Aerial Messages in Daytona Beach, Florida. At John B. Alexander High School in Laredo, Texas, senior student Isaac Garza asked his best friend, Kristelle, to prom in dramatic pre-planned chase scene with the school . Dressed in a tuxedo, and running into a packed assembly hall where Kristelle was waiting, unaware of what was going on, Mr Garza performed a rendition of Heath Ledger's famous scene in Ten Things I Hate About You, singing Lauren Hill's Can't Take My Eyes Off of You. Arresting: Palmdale, California student Davyeon was 'arrested' in his lunchroom thanks to prom date Stephanie. No word on how much she bribed the officer who cuffed him Not always pricey:\u00a0Mike Ramirez, student at Crosby High School in suburban Houston, managed to get Texans cheerleader\u00a0Caitlyn to go to the prom with him by getting 10,000 retweets Jamie Vandenberg from Ontario, Canada, promposed to his girlfriend Madison Dillion using a fake pop quiz that his teacher distributed at the beginning of class. As students reached question three, where Mr Vanenberg laid out statistical quandaries to Miss Dillon's yes or no answer, they realized their probability questionnaire was a ruse. When student Taylor Huestis opened her locker, 456 ping pong balls, all with 'prom' written on them, fell onto the floor. Huestis' boyfriend had planned the stunt for days, enlisting the help of her friends; his sign read 'I finally had the balls to ask you to prom!' Visa's prom survey also revealed some interesting regional and economic disparities. This year, Canadians plan to spend $508 overall on prom of which $151 will be on promposal, compared to $919 overall for U.S. families. Dads plan to outspend moms by 63%, $1160vs. $710. The Northeast took the spending crown and the Midwest continued its reputation for thrift: Source h/t CBS News",
