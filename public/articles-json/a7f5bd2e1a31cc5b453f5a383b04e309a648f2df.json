    "article": "A video taken from the point of view of a train driver captures a ride on the highest railway in Europe, the Jungfrau. The time lapse footage speeds along the 9km long electrified track, which leads from Kleine Scheidegg to Jungraujoch and stands at an elevation of 2061m and 3454m respectively. Opening in a tunnel built into a Swiss mountain, the train careers towards the light and out onto the snowy slopes to race alongside the many skiers. Turning a corner, the train moves at a slow and steady pace \u2013 the track barely visible from under the snow. Two people quickly cross the track in front of the train as it begins picking up speed and passes alongside a ledge that looks down on chalets below. The video then shows the train beginning its descent of the mountain, passing very close to a number of skiers who make their own way to the bottom of the slope. The video opens inside a tunnel build into the Swiss mountain as the train makes its way along the 9km long electrified track Turning right the train enters another tunnel and plunges back into darkness before re-emerging next to even more skiers. Suddenly the train begins travelling even faster as the banks of snow rise up higher alongside it. Like a bobsleigh the train hurtles down the track as the settlement at the bottom of the mountain slowly comes into view. The train emerges into the light and\u00a0passes very close to a number of skiers who make their own way to the bottom of the slope The train turns right to enter another tunnel and plunges back into darkness before re-emerging next to even more skiers Skiers on the distant mountain look like ants as the train begins slowing once more and the size of the banks decrease. A number of people can be seen crossing the track ahead as the train pulls into the station. The video concludes with the train finally arriving and making a controlled stop. The video concludes with the train picking up speed and hurtling down the track like a bobsleigh before arriving at the station The Jungfrau railway runs almost entirely within the Jungfrau Tunnel, built into the Eiger and M\u00f6nch mountains, and contains a total of five stations. The track was opened in 1912, 16 years after construction began in 1896. Today more than 800,000 people visit the attraction every year.",
